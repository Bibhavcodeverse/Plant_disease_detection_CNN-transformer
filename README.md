## 🚀 Features

- 🌱 **Plant disease detection** using leaf images
- 🧠 **Hybrid model**: Combines CNN (for feature extraction) and Transformer (for global context)
- 💾 Includes **saved model file** for inference or fine-tuning
- 📊 Model performance evaluation (accuracy, loss curves, etc.)

---

## 🧠 Model Overview

### Architecture:
- **CNN Backbone**: Extracts local spatial features
- **Transformer Encoder**: Captures global dependencies and attention
- **Fully Connected Layers**: For classification of plant disease categories
